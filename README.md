My name is Olivia. I am a student in the Web Development II class. I am a **_certified beginner_** in web development. However, I think that it is a great creative outlet. Speaking of outlets...

## My Hobbies 
 * Italian Language Learning 💚 🤍 ❤️
 * Gardening 💐
 * Cooking 🥘

I hope that by taking this course my knowledge and skill set in Web Development will expand.
